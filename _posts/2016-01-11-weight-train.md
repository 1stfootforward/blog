Unsure about lifting weight? Learn what weight training can do that no other exercise can.

##STRENGTHENS YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES
Weight training can increase bone density, reducing the risk of broken bones as you get older can also improve your  balance  as you strengthen your muscles.

##BURNS MORE CALORIES
Resistance Compound Exercises ( which I use with my clients ) will burn more calories than cardio because the effort is greater as you are using more muscle groups at the same time.
When you train cardio when you stop and your heart rate comes downs you stop burning calories, with resistance  ( weight training ) you will continue burning calories long after you finish your workout, you may even continue to burn Calories whilst you sleep!


##HELPS YOU BURN MORE FAT
In addition to burning calories will help your body burn more fat overall, this is because when we weight train at high intensity we will continue to burn fat after we finish for various reasons including oxygen deficits, metabolic changes and hormones. It's important to remember though weight training will burn fat and in turn build lean muscle which weighs more than fat although doesn't take up much room so although you will see yourself slimmer in the mirror there may not be in change on the scales.
Remember Strong is the new skinny!

##YOU CAN SEE PERSONAL GROWTH 
This is exactly why I love weight training, you can see and feel the changes within your body
For example you may start out doing a goblet squat with 4kg, struggling to make it to the end of your set, then next time it's easier and before you know it you are doing it with 8kg without even batting an eyelid.


##REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES 
As we age we naturally loose muscle mass, which makes us weaker and more prone to weight gain resistance  training can help slow down and age related muscle loss, which means your not only looking better but you are also protecting your health.
During exercise muscle tissue helps remove additional glucose and triglycerides from your bloodstream which can help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. There is also evidence that suggests that resistance training can help reduce high blood pressure.


##YOU CAN DO IT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
You can rack up hours in a cardio session, trying to beat your personal  best, whilst we would all love to have that much time most of us don't and trying to slot in a time to train can often feel difficult. Fortunately with resistance training you don't need to spend hours, just by completing 2 to 3 30 minute sessions per week in addition to some light cardio sessions will be enough to burn those unwanted calories
