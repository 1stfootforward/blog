There is so many reasons why personal trainers and health professionals like myself love Protein.

Not only does protein help build and repair muscle, it also plays a role in speeding up our fat burning metabolism all whilst reducing those hunger pains, that can in turn lead us to eating whatever is fastest, which is usually food we don’t need or want in our bodies.

It also works to slow down the release of carbohydrates into our bloodstream, which can prevent sudden spikes in our blood sugar, that are thought to encourage fat storage and lagging energy levels.


## Here’s a List of 12 High in Protein foods you can find in any Supermarket



- **Greek Yogurt**

Not only high in protein about 23g per 100g serving, you will also reap the rewards of gut-friendly probiotic bacteria and bone building calcium.

- **Cottage Cheese**
This cheese product is filled with casein protein – a slow digesting protein that supplies your growing muscles with vital Amino acids.

*TIP* Some cottage cheese products are high in sodium, check the labels and choose one that’s low in sodium

- **Eggs**
With 6g protein per egg in my opinion is the best source, so many ways you can eat eggs my favourite being poached.
