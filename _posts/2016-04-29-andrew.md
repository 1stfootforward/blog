## Andrew's story

At the age of 39, I was very unhealthy I weighed 105 kg, I suffered from severe asthma and just felt puffed and tired all of the time. A recent visit to the doctor gave me the final push to do something about it, my doctor told me I needed to start to shift the fat off me as it was making my asthma worse and at 40 it gets harder to move.

I’m self-motivated in everything I do except exercise I wasn’t good at it, I felt embarrassed going to the gym, meeting Heather at 1st-footforward changed everything, being able to go to a gym environment but still just having a 1 on 1 session worked for me, having someone else accountable for my goals as well and having someone to push me and support me to reach my goals really worked!

I’m finishing up now at 1st-footforward to pursue greater career options with new found confidence.

8 months on I now weigh 85 kg, my asthma has improved dramatically, I feel great, the photo shows the rest

1st foot forward comment

Andrew had great results @1stfootforward! I design programs to suit you and your goals, Andrew completed two 1 on 1 sessions per week and also attended group sessions / boot camp once per week, and although he has left Christchurch, I am still writing his programs and supporting him to reach his goals.
