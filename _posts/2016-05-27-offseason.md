#### Timing 
Getting the timing right it crucial when weight training during on season as you don’t want it to affect your training or game, have one recovery between each session for example if you play your game on a Saturday and have Practice on a Thursday Night I would recommend lifting on a Monday.

#### Pre-season  
Make a slow and conscious effort to add more of the types of activity you'll be doing at your training seasons at least a month before your season starts, to avoid unnecessary shock to the body. You can  continue to lift close to your maximum during this time. This is a good time to consult a personal trainer and map out your goals for the season.

#### Byes and weeks off 
Take advantage of any gaps you have during the season, to temporarily increase the intensity of your sessions, particularly in your large compound lifts. This will allow you to check how your progress is going. Be sure to warm up properly anytime you increase your lift load, use a spotter and ensure your diet is spot on to make the most of this time.


#### Lift light and fast
Train at about 85% of you max offseason weight and focus mainly on speed, again though it depends on which sport you play and your goals. This is also a good time to add new lifts to your sessions: start with a minimum weight and medium volume focusing on good form.

#### Focus on Recovery
Spend extra time stretching and foam rolling, before and after sessions, to get out any tight muscles. Most importantly though remember to get at least 8 hours sleep per night. Try not to drink any alcohol for about 4 hours after your games and make sure any sprains or bruises are iced. Even small injuries, not properly cared for can affect your training.

#### Maintain a healthy diet 
By eating healthy, you will find you have more energy to use, you will feel healthier and it will improve your game and performance. In particular, be sure to get enough varied protein in your diet the days around game day. While supplements can help be sure to check out my list of protein sources [here.](http://www.1stfootforward.co.nz/blog/diet/Protein/)

#### Sorting out any problem areas 
If you have pain or a light niggle get it sorted before it becomes an  injury, try to stay active through your  recovery, regress your session, maybe just doing Body weight resistant exercise, and swapping barbells to dumbbells, could help.

#### Get a Trainer
By having a trainer, you can eliminate injury and training in the wrong program, don’t waste precious time training when it’s not benefiting you or your chosen sport.
