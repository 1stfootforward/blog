##### Upper Back and Neck pain are also common problems presented to me at my gym.

This pain can literally stop you in your tracks, preventing you from doing simple tasks and also enjoying your life.

The reasons behind these problems can vary so I definitely advise you to see your doctor.

Although most of the time it comes down to our posture; how we are holding ourselves whilst standing, moving and especially sitting.

By not doing anything to fix the problem, our muscles end up tensing around the problem area to protect it, and this can evolve into other issues including stiffness and tension headaches.

I often get asked for a simple but effective stretching routine for a tight Upper Back and Neck.

This routine is suitable for beginners, simple enough to be able to do at home or at the gym.

## Routine 1 (2–4 minutes)

Dynamic Stretches: perform these before exercising, start slowly, with small movements, increasing the range of motion as the muscles warm up.

### 1. Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, keeping your arms straight down next to your body with your palms facing backwards

Swing your arms in front of you, then behind you, increasing your range of motion each time so your arms will eventually be behind you and then above your head.

Complete 10 times

### 2. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, with your arms to the side like a T shape.

Keeping your lower body still, rotate your upper body to the left then the right.

Repeat 10 times

### 3. This can be done sitting or standing, making sure your abdominal muscles are braced and your back is straight.

Place your hands behind your neck for extra support, remember to go slowly.

Bring your head forward till your chin meets your neck, then back again till you are looking at the ceiling. You may not get all the way forwards or backwards depending on how tight your muscles are; the more you do this the more range of motion you will have.

## Routine 2 – Static Stretches

Also suitable for beginners, complete this routine at the end of your workout.

### 1. Standing with legs shoulder width apart, place one hand on your hip and the other on your head, move your neck slowly to the right until you can feel the stretch and hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side

### 2. Using a door frame or squat rack, place your hands on either side and then walk through the door.

Hold for 30 seconds

### 3. Standing, feet shoulder width apart, clasp your hands in front of you with your thumbs pointing down, round your shoulders, keeping your abdominal muscles braced and reach forward.

Hold for 30 seconds
