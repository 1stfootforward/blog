### My top 3 Reasons why you should be strengthening your core

1. Having a strong core will help prevent injuries

2. By building a strong core you will also build core stability and improve balance, because when we train our core the muscles in our pelvis, lower back, hips, and abdominals work in harmony.

3. By gaining Harmony, Stability and Balance we are less likely to injure ourselves whether it’s on the playing field or just daily tasks, having a strong core will protect us.


Having a strong core in most cases will prevent or remove back pain.

Back pain is a very common side effect of a weak core so strengthening it will balance out front and back.

Many of us find we are sitting most of the time, this can cause problems especially if we are sitting on a tilted pelvis and an arched back, we should be sitting tall with our abdominals braced.

Try sitting on a balance ball / Swiss ball instead of a normal chair. As you will have to sit tall and have your abdominals braced to support your balance.

### Fix your Posture

I’m sure you have heard how important it is to have good posture. For not only it benefits in our health, well-being, appearance and stability.

Bad Posture can cause many problems including lower back and upper back pain.

By strengthening your core it helps to improve muscle memory, by working the muscles deep within the body especially the ones around the spine.

You will automatically stand taller and better posture will follow.


### My Top 5 Core Strengthening Exercises

* __Front Squat__

* __Deadlift__

* __Push Press__

* __Chin ups__

* __BB Back Row__


If you have never been taught these exercises I recommend you get a trainer to guide and teach you proper technique, although these are fantastic exercises they could cause injury when performed incorrectly 

Although the abdominal muscles aren't the primary muscle used in these exercises, it is the core that stabilizes the body, keeping the back straight and balancing the body. By adding weight to these exercises it adds resistance strengthening the core more as you go.

1000’s of crunches will not give you abs the above exercise will

The reason I include crunch exercises into my clients' training is to activate the core muscles, Also it’s a good way to test core strength.


### My Top 5 Core Activating Exercises 


#### Plank

Start with your elbows under your shoulders, with your arms straight, have your feet shoulder width apart, lift up your body keeping your hips down, brace your abdominal muscles, keeping a straight back.

Hold. Start by holding for 5 secs then increase your time as you get stronger.

__Tip__ - you should only feel this exercise in your abdominal muscles if you are feeling the plank else where you are either holding it for too long or you are not doing it properly.

#### In and out Crunch

This exercise is fantastic for activating the lower abdominal muscles.  Start by lying on the ground, bring your legs and arms in towards the Centre of your body, brace you abdominal muscles then slowly move your legs and arms out away from your body. The trick with this exercise is to make sure your lower back stays flat on the ground. This sounds easier than it is, so go slow you may only be able to go out a few centimetre’s to start, you will get stronger the more you perform the exercise.

#### Windmills

These are great to activate your oblique’s 

Stand slightly wider than shoulder width apart, one hand on your hip, the other in the air, you can add weight to this arm if you would like. Keep your eyes on the weight or the empty hand, slowly twist your body bringing the hand on your hip down the inside of your leg.

You may not be able to get far to start, as your get stronger your will go further.
