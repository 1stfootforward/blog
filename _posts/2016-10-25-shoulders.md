## Solutions for Tight Shoulders

Tight Shoulders can lead to many problems, the first being posture. If your shoulders are tight your body might be scrunched over or pushing forward and this is putting pressure on your upper back,  soft tissue and joints and in some cases,  creating a hunched back.


Many factors can contribute to tight shoulders and the main ones that I see are

+        Someone who has a desk job, who sits in front of a computer, with their head in the same position for hours at a time.
+        When someone is under high levels of stress, this can cause our ribcage to drop and  make our shoulders come forward.

Shoulder and neck muscles are often the first to feel stress and tension because shoulders are not just joints on their own, they are a part of the neck, ribs, and scapula which together gives our upper bodies our huge range of motion, allowing us to perform a wide range of movements. This  means the whole area relies on muscle stability which is different from the ball and socket in our hips. So when shoulder muscles get overused, underused or misused, we are left with a limited range of motion and sometimes pain, and this is why it’s important to stretch these muscles.

 

**Follow this Shoulder Stretch Routine to gain functional range of motion**

 

####         Dislocations
This name shouldn’t scare you. In my opinion, this is the best way to gain range of motion in the shoulders. Start with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a stick (hands on top of stick), keeping arms straight lift arms over the body to behind the back

####         Chin Retractions
Slowly push your chin out, then slowly bring it back towards your throat

####           Arm Circles
Keeping Arms straight, make circles forwards and then backward.

####         Goalposts
Stand with your back to the wall, keeping your scapula rested in a neutral position.

####       Standing Wall
