### Superhero Workouts

Superhero movies are all the rage at the moment, with many a blog, magazine or newspaper article written every time we learn a new actor will be taking on a superhero role. The physical transformations actors go through can be both dramatic and inspirational. I've waded through the most popular superhero workouts to bring you the best of the best. Check out these blog posts to find yourself a **Super Workout!**

####   [MuscleandFitness.com's Wonder Woman's ( Gal Gadot ) Workout ](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/wonder-woman-workout)

Gal Gadot's switch from fashion model to amazonian wonder woman was a serious challenge. Gal started where most of us do, unable to perform a single pull-up. This workout is great for people just starting out.

 Intensity: **Intermediate**

####   [PopWorkouts'  Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence ) Workout](https://www.popworkouts.com/jennifer-lawrence-workout-diet/)

Jennifer's preparation for the hunger games was less about building a super body and more about preparing for the challenging stunt work the films required. Jennifer's preparation also included rock climbing a fun hobby that's also a great full body workout.

 Intensity: **Intermediate**

####   [Super Hero Jacked's Doctor Strange ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) Workout](http://superherojacked.com/2016/10/30/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-workout-diet-bulked-role/2/)

Doctor Strange is no ordinary superhero, and Benedict Cumberbatch's preparation was no ordinary workout routine. Including long endurance yoga sessions, walking, sprinting and plenty of free weights. This routine is great for anyone looking to get out of their comfort zone.

 Intensity: **Disciplined**

![Captain America (Chris Evans)]({{ site.url }}/images/superhero/captain-america.jpg)

####   [FitMole.com's Captain America (Chris Evans) Workout](http://www.fitmole.org/chris-evans-workout/)

Chris's preparation for the Captain America and Avengers movies focused primarily on visuals, especially the elusive V-taper. This routine features plenty of isolation exercises and will be a stark change for those use to full body compound movements or long cardio sessions.

 Intensity: **Disciplined**

![Thor (Chris Hemsworth)]({{ site.url }}/images/superhero/thor.jpg)

####   [Muscleandfitness.com's Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Workout](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/chris-hemsworths-god-thor-workout)

Unlike some of the other actors on this list, Chris Hemsworth was already in great shape. This workout routine would be suitable for people already in great shape looking to bulk up, in particular, those looking for large arms.

 Intensity: **Athlete**

####   [PopWorkout's Batman (Ben Affleck) Workout](https://www.popworkouts.com/ben-affleck-batman-workout/)

Ben Affleck's transformation for his role as Batman is probably the most dramatic change on this list. This workout routine is intense, as Affleck needed to quickly gain both size, and drop body fat, while also developing the strength and fitness needed for the role .

 Intensity: **Batman**
