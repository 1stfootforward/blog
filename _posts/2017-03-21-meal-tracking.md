The main reason I recommend to track and record your meals and exercise is because if you want to improve in something, you need to track you progress and behaviors this is known as “self-monitoring” The process of tracking and analyzing your thoughts and actions help you to become aware of how your choices impact your goals.
Whatever your goal may be, eating and exercise habits are the two things that control your outcome.

Below are 5 reasons tracking, eating and exercise can be so useful. It will play a huge role, in the reaching of your goals.

### YOU WILL START TO EAT LESS 
It can be very confronting writing down and later reading what food you are consuming, especially in the first few days – automatically you will try to eat less, do better as the week goes on.

### You will exercise more
When you start to record your exercise habits again you will find yourself competing against yourself to do better, a simple tool to start with is wearing the pedometer given to you with this pack.
Wear it record your results on day one try to do better every day, on a rest day take it off the last thing you will need is demotivation.

### You will receive instant gratification 
One of the main reason we often fail is because we want to see results straight away and since good things take time by record get your own habits will show you within a few days your moving forward, as it immediately gives you feedback on your progress. By tracking calories and exercise intensity you will know immediately how your choices will contribute to or detract from your fitness goals
  
### Become more flexible about What, When & How much you eat
Make this work for you, there is nothing worse than restrictions that stop you living your life! Tracking food and exercise allows you to budget your time, calories and food choices. 
For example, making rules like
+   No eating after 6 pm
+   No foods with added sugar
+   500 calories or less per meal

What if you have a party to go to in the evening or you are going on a late date, or you may want a high-calorie meal sometimes or everything on the menu contains sugar.
Self-tracking solves these problems as you can plan ahead, have daily or weekly sugar targets instead of meal-targets, also if you know you are going out you could eat fewer calories over the other meals to even things out. Self-tracking gives you full control over your food choices and eating schedule.

### Avoid weight loss plateaus
If you track your weight and measurements on a regular basis you will be able to see how far you are from achieving your goal and how fast you are
 progressing, recording this will make it easier to make adjustments to your diet and exercise.
