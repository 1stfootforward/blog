#### Concussion & Contact Sports
 
Concussion is a very hot topic in the news lately, especially after the film Concussion starring Will Smith came out. Also Last year Otago University ran a study about the connection between neck strength and concussion. They used the Otago Rugby team to conduct their tests, read about it here www.otago.ac.nz>publicpost 
Contact sport players are more at risk of getting a concussion, whilst kids and teens are most at risk. Imagine the pressure on your neck and head as you perform a header in soccer, getting hit in the head during boxing or martial arts and tackled at full force on the Rugby field.
Heading into contact sport season it is especially important for you and your children to be as prepared as possible when it comes to having a strong neck!

If you can imagine your neck as a pedestal, holding your head, which houses your brain. If the neck wasn’t strong enough to hold your head up you wouldn’t be able to function properly. The neck muscles contract all day to adjust your head’s posture, these muscles therefore endure the most compared to any other muscles.

Having a stronger neck is also greatly needed to reduce the risk of neck injury, trauma of the central nervous system, brain trauma, whiplash, nerve damage and concussion. By making the neck stronger it will be able to take the majority of an impact preventing the head spinning sideways too quickly and jarring of the head/brain.
