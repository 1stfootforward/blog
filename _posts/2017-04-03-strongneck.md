####The Importance of a strong neck
Heading into contact sport season it is especially important for you and your children to be as prepared as possible when it comes to having a strong neck!

If you can imagine your neck as a pedestal, holding your head, which houses your brain. If the neck wasn’t strong enough to hold your head up you wouldn’t be able to function properly. The neck muscles contract all day to adjust your head’s posture, these muscles therefore endure the most compared to any other muscles.

Having a stronger neck is also greatly needed to reduce the risk of neck injury, trauma of the central nervous system, brain trauma, whiplash, nerve damage and concussion. By making the neck stronger it will be able to take the majority of an impact preventing the head spinning sideways too quickly and jarring of the head/brain.

##Chin to Sky
Looking straight ahead, keeping jaw closed, slowly tilt your head back, until your chin is pointing to the sky

##Neck Circles
Facing straight ahead, slowly move your head in a circular motion

##After stretching, below are some strengthening neck exercises,
##I advise you to seek extra help if you are not confident doing these on your own.

##DB Shrugs
Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, feet pointing forward. Holding your core and glutes braced to protect your back. Holding a DB in each hand, arms straight down side of body.
Slowly raise your shoulders towards the ceiling back down and repeat making sure the shoulders don't go forwards or back.

##Face down plate resistance
Lie on the floor or bench on you stomach, place a weighted plate on the back of your head, holding onto it for support. Lift you head of the ground slowly, bringing chin up, then slowly back to the ground repeat.
