There are 2 forms of fibre - soluble and insoluble.

## Soluble fibre

Dissolves in water forming into a gel in the stomach. The gel like substance produced slows down the rate at which food moves from your stomach to the small intestines. Oatmeal, nuts, beans and lentils all contain a healthy amount. Like when you cook oatmeal it becomes gooey that’s the presence of soluble fibre.
