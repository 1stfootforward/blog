# Benefits

+	 Skin & Aging

	Essentially proving that chia seeds are one of nature’s riches antioxidants. Antioxidants speed up the skin’s repair systems, and prevent further damage. Taking chia seeds can prevent premature skin aging due to inflammation free radical damage.

+	 Digestive Health

	Chia is super-high in fiber, providing nearly 11 grams per ounce.  
	Fiber is essential for your body’s ability to balance insulin levels.  According to the National Institute of Health, seeds like flax and chia can be a natural blood sugar balancer due to its high fiber content and healthy fats. Being high in dietary fiber, chia helps promote bowel regularity and healthy stool. The rich fiber content in chia seeds also helps people feel fuller quicker because it absorbs a considerable amount of water and immediately expands in the stomach when eaten. This may explain why clinical studies have proven that chia curbs hunger and suppresses appetite, which can also lead to weight loss. Also, when consumed, chia seeds create a gelatin-like substance in the stomach.  This gel-forming action is due to the soluble fiber in chia seeds and it can work as a prebiotic supporting the growth of probiotics in the gut.

+	 Heart Health

	Chia seeds’ ability to reverse inflammation, regulate cholesterol and lower blood pressure make it extremely beneficial to consume for heart health. Also, by reversing oxidative stress, someone is less likely to develop atherosclerosis when they’re regularly consuming chia seeds.

Chia also contains boron which is another essential nutrient for bone health. Boron helps metabolize calcium, magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus for healthy growth of bones and muscles. 

+	 Build Muscle & Lose Weight

	Chia seeds also rank among the top plant based sources of protein.  This is another reason this super seed is great to consume for those trying to put on lean muscle, burn fat, and balance blood sugar levels. Chia seeds pack a powerful antioxidant punch to help replace some of those nutrients lost when exercising. They’re high in essential minerals like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, iron and niacin.
	One of the characteristics that make chia so unique is that it can absorb up to 10X its own weight in water.  Because of this, chia seeds can prolong hydration and improve nutrient absorption of electrolytes. This also slows digestion and keeps you feeling fuller longer reducing sugar cravings.        And because chia seeds are also high in zinc, they help your body increase leptin. Leptin is a key hormone that regulates your bodies appetite, how your body spends energy and regulates how your energy levels!

Vitamin A and phosphorus are also important for strong teeth and a healthy mouth.


# How to Eat Chia Seeds

Chia seeds have a mild nutty taste and can easily be added to most dishes as a garnish, yet chewing small seeds like flax or chia generally doesn’t make the omega-3’s and other nutrients readily available for digestion and assimilation. The best way to access their vitamins and minerals is to either grind or soak them.

# Raw vs. Soaking

There seems to be much debate as to whether you need to soak chia seeds before eating. It won’t hurt to eat them straight, but if you soak them, then you “sprout” them and it releases the “enzyme inhibitors” that are used to protect the seed. One, this makes it much easier to digest, and two, your body can then access the dense nutrients inside the seeds. In my opinion, you always want to get the most nutrition out of any food that you eat, so I prefer soaking them before adding them to my recipe or smoothie, if possible. Either way, they are still an excellent source of nutrition!

# How to Soak

To soak chia seeds, simply mix them in a 1:10 ratio chia to water. That’s about 1.5 tablespoons chia seeds in one cup of water. It does not have to be exact, but you do want it to gel all the way and not be too watery. Then let them sit for about 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Since chia seeds can hold up to 12 times its weight in water, they are wonderful to prevent dehydration. However, if you choose not to soak them, then they can also absorb water from you during digestion.  So, make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated.

# Ground

Another option is to grind chia seeds in a coffee grinder to break down the hard-outer shell before eating them. When pulverized, chia seed flour can be used in most gluten-free recipes like pancakes, muffins, breads and even pastas. When grinding omega-3 rich seeds, however, it is important to store them in a sealed, glass container in your refrigerator or freezer.

# Whole

Unlike flaxseeds, you do not have to grind chia seeds to access their nutrition. You can eat them whole and still get their “energy-packed” punch! You can even just eat a spoonful straight – but beware – they do tend to stick in your teeth!
