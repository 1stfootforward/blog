Our knees are so important, walking, running climbing and dancing are all moves that we need our knees for.
The knee is the largest joint in our bodies. The upper leg bone - femur and lower leg bones - tibia and fibula are connected by a complicated system of ligaments, muscles, tendons and cartilage making them prone to injury.

#### Injuries can occur in the knee for a number of reasons, mostly from sports or recreational activities these could include:

+	Sprains and Strains to the ligaments and tendons that support the knee cap

+	A tear in the cartilage cushion in the knee joint

+	Ligament tears - most commonly being the medial collateral Ligament

+	Breaks and Fractures of either the kneecap, lower part of the femur or the top part of the tibia or fibula.

+	Kneecap dislocation 

+	Loose bodies - where pieces of bone or tissues from a fracture or dislocation that may get caught in the joint and interfere with movement

+	Knee joint dislocation this is pretty rare and will only happen with great force seek medical attention immediately

#### Overuse injuries can also occur after repetitive activities such as stair climbing, bike riding, jogging, and jumping. These injuries usually include:

+	Inflammation of the small sacs of fluid that cushion and lubricate the knee joint

+	Inflammation of the tendons or small tears in the tendons

+	Thickening or folding of the knee ligaments

+	Pain in front of the knee is usually caused by overuse or excess weight

+	Irritation and Inflammation of the band or fibrous tissue that runs down the outside of the thigh.

Treatments for knee pain, problems or injury may include 1st Aid, rest, bracing, physical therapy, medicine and some cases surgery. However, you can prevent injury and in some cases relieve knee pain by strengthening the muscles that support your knees and put less stress on your knee joints. Having strong quadriceps and hamstrings can help your knee joint absorb shock better making less strain on your knees preventing injury.

### Below are some knee strengthening and stretches for you to try to start strengthening your knees.

•	LEG LIFT

Lying on the ground on your back, bend one leg keeping the foot flat on the ground. With the other leg, keeping the leg straight slightly lift off the ground. Hold the leg hovering above the ground for as long as you can. Release and repeat 4 times on each leg.

•	STRAIGHT LEG LIFT 

Same set up as above, however, this time raise your leg as high as you can and hold. Release and repeat 4 times on each leg

•	BRIDGE

Lying on the ground on you back bend both knees and have your feet flat on the floor, then raise your bottom off the ground and hold. Repeat 8 times. 

•	KNEE EXTENSION

Sitting on a chair, lift one leg up to parallel from the ground. Hold, repeat on each leg 4 times.

•	CALF RAISE 


Standing tall with your core braced ( if needed hold on to something for support ). Lift your heels off the ground, hold for about 5 seconds then release repeat exercise for at least 10 times. 

•	BUTT KICKS
