My name is Heather and I started 1st Foot Forward In, September 2015.

##### Below is a little bit about me and how I got into Personal Training, why I did and how 1st Foot Forward started.

In my teens and 20’s I sat around the 55 – 57 kg mark, I worked in Hospitality and did a lot of traveling, eating and partying. I worked long hours to fund my travel. My active lifestyle kept my weight at bay.
When I returned to NZ at age 25 I studied to be a chef. Cooking has always been a passion of mine it was my favourite subject at school and a hobby I did in my own time. I studied and worked full time, after 2 years I was qualified and ready to take on the industry.

When I got pregnant at 28 being a chef was hard the long hours and stressful work environment didn’t suit anymore and it was the 1st time in my life I realized just how weak I was. Everything was a struggle, so I didn’t do much. Dealing with my food cravings of milk, chocolate, and cheeseburgers, on top of not being active my weight just got out of control. By the time I had my daughter I was 75 kg’s and I put an extra 12 kg’s on in the next 3 months to follow.
It took me another 2 1/2 years to do something about it, this is a picture of me at my biggest. At 87 kg’s

#### My daughter is 2 .5 years old in this picture. This is where my journey to get back to me began.

First I followed the big fitness personalities on Facebook and tried as many fast fixed diets I possibly could to see results fast.
When I Realised these weren’t working for me I signed up for a gym. I liked it, I had a PT to tell me what to do, but he gave me cardio most of the time, and since I wasn’t confident enough to say  I wasn’t a fan it put me off going back to see him. I continued on at the gym on my own but outsourced for a PT away from the gym to teach me weights and Strength. This brought me confidence and power, things I hadn’t felt for such a long time.

This is when I decided I could make a real difference in the fitness industry for women starting out or returning to exercise after a while away. This is when I decided to study to become a PT.

Once qualified I opened up a platform for women to come and train, either in a one on one class or small group training. That is when I launched women's beginner's box fit. Letting others share in the power and strength you get from putting on the gloves which set of encouragement around the room making the sessions addictive and popular. Some clients have come and gone whilst most have stayed and have continued to progress and see results.

From here HIIT camp was born, being flexible is one thing, however, I wanted to offer more. Being busy women I wanted a class to be short and intense so everyone could join in. These classes again were popular burning calories fast and for long after you finish the workout making it the best for everyone who is short on time.

Just recently I have started two more classes  S.E.T which are strength and endurance training, using the barbell as resistance.

And Just Stretch a yoga inspired movement prep class. This class everyone needs, it gives our bodies a chance to relax and destress. Opening up our joints and regaining flexibility is a key needed to live a long, healthy and comfortable life.
I specialize in bring Strength, Power, Endurance, and Confidence to women of all ages and fitness levels

### My Qualifications are:

+	Certificate 3 Exercise Consultant (NZIHF)

+	Certificate 4 & 5 Personal Training (NZIHF)

These qualifications are my greatest achievements so far. Giving me the opportunity to help women get the results they want

+	Certificate 3, 4 & 5 Cooking with distinction (CPIT)

Studying in ChCh and interrupted by the earthquakes I managed to pass with distinction. A passion I continue to use on a day to day basis. This diploma gives me an insider view, opening up challenges with recipes changing them from unhealthy to healthy.

+	First Aid Certificate

Having the knowledge of food from being a chef, the understanding of what shift work is like in real time, the emotion and rollercoaster feelings being a mum and trying to find time just for you.
##### I get it I understand.

##### I've been there myself. 

That’s why I make my classes as flexible as they can be. 

##### Unfortunately no one can change you.

No one can do it for you. Putting your first foot forward is the only way to get started This is how my business name started. I now have the best job. Working alongside some amazing women who are reaching their goals every single day.

Now at age 33, I have the strongest and toned body I have ever had.
I'm looking forward to sharing that feeling with all my clients as they train to reach their goals.
