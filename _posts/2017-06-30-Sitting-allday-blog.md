Does your job require you to sit all day? 
Moving around is good for you. It’s good for your physical health as well as your mental health.
Sitting or lying for too long increases your risk of chronic health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, bad circulation and It could be affecting your weight loss goals as well. One of the most common and very physical symptoms of living much of your life in a seated position is the presence of back and neck pain. Cradling a phone to your ear and jutting your neck and head forward while working at a computer leads to strains in your cervical vertebrae which causes neck strain, sore shoulders, and back pain. The very act of sitting puts added pressure on your spine and compresses the disks that make up your back. If you are suffering from back and neck pain check out these links for stretches you can do to help.

 Thinking about backaches, you should also be worried about the impact of sitting on your internal organs. When you sit for a long period of time your muscles burn less fat and your blood begins to flow slowly, allowing fatty acids to easily clog your heart. Sitting has been linked to high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, your pancreas may over produce insulin, which can lead to diabetes.


#### Being active is not as hard as you think.

There are lots of simple ways to include some physical activity in your day. Even if you spend most of the day in the office, try implanting these ideas into your days.

##### Build more activity into your day by changing how you get to and from work.

+	Walk or cycle 
+	Park further away
+	Use the stairs, all of the way, ½ the way
+	Get a pedometer and set a goal

##### Start being more active at work as well, you’d be surprised at all the things you can do.

+	Walk to talk to your colleagues instead of sending an email
+	Take lunch away from your desk, get outside and go for a walk
+	Organize walking and standing meeting as a health initiative 
+	Do hourly stretches for your joints ( check out my favourite sitting routine below )

If your typical day consists of sitting in the car driving to work, sitting at work, sitting to drive home then to relax you find yourself sitting again you may also find you sleep in a curled/seated position as well. This isn’t good for you, the human body is made to stand up straight! Our heart and cardiovascular system work more effectively this way. Our bowel also functions more efficiently when we are upright. It is common for people who are bedridden in the hospital to experience problems with their bowel function. When you are physically active, on the other hand, your overall energy levels and endurance improve, and your bones maintain strength. Which is optimal as we age.

##### It may be easier to move more whilst you are home so below are a few ideas to move more at home.

+	When you are tidying up making more trips taking moving small amounts at a time
+	Walk when you are on your phone
+	Include exercise into your chores ( see below )


### Movement you can do during the day whilst sitting.

+	##### Stretching your Wrists.

	Placing one hand in front of you fingers pointing to the roof and palm facing away from you, using your other hand put pressure on the palm towards your forearm  slowly push then release repeating 10 x on each wrist

+	##### Practicing, your Posture.

	Sitting up tall, shoulders back and chest proud, brace your core ( bring your belly button towards your chest ) continuing to breathe normal hold for as long as you can then repeat

+	##### Toe heel tap.

	Sitting up straight tap your heels to the ground your toes, start with 10 seconds at a time then try and beat your score.

+	##### Shoulder Circles.

	Roll your shoulders forward, then backward for at least 30 seconds each

#### Movements you can include to your daily chores.

+	#### Walking Lunges.

	These can be included to any walking chore, mine is the house dipping of washing or collecting it.

+	#### Bench or Table Press ups

	Whilst waiting for the toaster to pop or the jug to boil perform a few press ups. This incline move takes the pressure of an upper body movement away, one the bench is too easily move to a lower object

+	#### Squats

Squat when you need to pick something up off the floor or if you are cleaning a toilet or just watching TV.
