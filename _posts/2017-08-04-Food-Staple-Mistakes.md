When we think of homemade food, we tend to believe it to be healthy, and for the most part, it is but when we use store bought staple items and add them to our homemade food it can dramatically change the nutrition level of your food. The key to maintaining a healthy diet comes down to the types of foods and ingredients you use in your cooking. By being equipped with the right foods, you can find it so much easier to eat healthily

### Below are some items to consider and alternatives to using instead.



#### Table Salt.

Whilst not all salt is created equal (sodium) also known as salt is a mineral that we need in our diets in small amounts. Table salt is the worst of all the salts as even though it originates from sea salt, it is often stripped of many of its naturally occurring minerals during processing. This sometimes can include being mixed with additives, heated to high temperatures, and is bleached white. So, you are usually left with is a very refined product that offers nothing in the way of nutrition.

#### Alternatives:

The best alternatives for table salt are ones that are as close as possible to their natural form. Some examples include Himalayan salt and Celtic Sea salt. These salts can come in rock formation and you can choose to grind them yourself or use them whole depending on what you are cooking. The price of these purer salts may be a little higher, however, for the sake of the nutritional benefits, I think this is a staple worth the extra price!



#### Bottled Sauces.

In New Zealand, you can’t go to a barbeque without there being tomato sauce on the table. Bottled sauces can be a staple for many dishes, especially if you are at a party or social gathering. The issue with sauces such as barbeque, tomato, pasta sauces, and dressings is that they often contain a large amount of sugar and salt. As well as preservatives to prolong their shelf life and/or artificial colours to make them look more vibrant and appealing. While it may be a great convenience to grab them from the pantry, they could be stopping you from getting the results you want.

#### Alternatives:

If you’re someone that has a small dollop of bottled sauce on your meal from time to time, then there’s no need to be concerned. However, if you’re a regular “saucer”, then you might want to consider finding an alternative! I think that a fresh, homemade sauce is always better than one pulled off of the shelves in terms of both nutrition and taste. There are so many amazing recipes that you can find in cookbooks and online these days, which is super handy. However, if you are in a situation where you are pushed for time and can’t make your own, then I recommend choosing varieties that are as low in added sugar and salt as you can find.

#### Deli Meat.

Deli meats (processed meat) such as ham, salami, bacon, pastrami, hot dogs and other sausages are a refrigerator staple for many people. The main issue with these foods is that they usually include preservatives, called nitrates. These are generally added to help prevent the growth of bacteria, prevent spoilage, and give these foods their colour and flavour. Deli meats can also be incredibly high in salt and saturated fat. Again, eating these in small portions every once in awhile is okay, but if they are a daily staple for you, then you may want to look at finding healthier alternatives.

#### Alternatives:

Instead of buying deli meat, try using freshly cooked chicken breast or beef. You can grill or poach a batch every few days so you always have some ready to put into sandwiches or salads. Having fresher versions means you’re likely to get more of the nutrients that these foods have to offer and less of the hidden extras.



#### Fruit Yoghurt.

Fruit flavoured yoghurts may market themselves as using “real fruit” but this isn’t necessarily a lot of fruit and can be often misinterpreted. Instead of using real fruit pieces, some manufacturers could actually just be using fruit juice, fruit puree or fruit juice concentrate. While the origins of these things may well be fruit, most of the nutrients that it would usually contain are often lost during processing. So essentially all you’re left with is the fruit sugar, and something that was intended to be a healthy snack has become more of a dessert!

#### Alternatives:

Rather than going for store bought fruit flavoured yoghurt, I recommend that you stick with plain varieties. If you’re after fruit flavoured yoghurt, try adding in your own fruit instead. Some of my favourites are berries cooked down into a coulis or grated apple with a touch of cinnamon. This also means you can buy just one yoghurt but have multiple flavours whenever you want.

Next time you are going grocery shopping, try swapping out some of your regular staples with the ones I have mentioned above. Making different choices can be the difference between achieving your goals and not
