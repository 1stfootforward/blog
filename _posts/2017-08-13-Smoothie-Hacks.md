Smoothies as a health kick is here to stay so we might as well utilize and maximize the smoothie recipe to the fullest. 
Below are 6 of my top smoothie ideas and tips to help you get the best out of your smoothies. 


#### Fresh vs Frozen.

We all know fresh is best, but when looking for fresh berries in the middle of winter can be hard to do. Don’t worry about it, frozen fruit is not only more accessible but at times more affordable and really convenient. Also acts as ice to make your smoothie super cold.

#### No wastage.

Having fresh raw greens in the fridge and running out of time to use them that week? Take your dark leafy greens or any other vegetable that you have in the fridge and wash, chop, and store in a large freezer safe bag or airtight glass container to make your own frozen vegetables. Kale and Spinach are ones that I will often freeze, and it’s an easy way to add more fiber and greens to any smoothie. 
This can also be done with the end of your milk, pour any left over liquids like milk, coconut milk, tea or coffee into ice cube trays for easy to use portions at a later date. 


#### Plan Ahead.

Have an easy go to smoothie recipe you love and want to make sure you have it each morning while saving time? Just like the concept of meal prep, you can evenly divide all ingredients out for each day/each recipe into a Ziploc bag. Then all you do is literally grab the bag out of the freezer, put the contents in the blender, add liquid, and blend! Breakfast in less than 5 minutes.

#### Blend ahead of Time.

Have some about-to-turn produce? Blend it and pour it into ice cube trays for a quick ingredient add-in. For example: bananas! Puree the banana and pour it into an ice cube tray (label it so you know what fruit/vegetable it is for later). Also think outside of the box with vegetables like carrots, kale, spinach, etc. 
TIP: Cook or steam beets, carrots, or sweet potatoes and blend them for added vegetables.

#### Add protein and superfoods. 

Do you need to add protein powder to every smoothie? No, but it’s great for making a smoothie into a full meal, and the superfoods add even more nutrient density to the smoothie. For an end product you’ll have easier digestion, which equals easier absorption of these nutrients and more energy.

#### Try smoothie bowls.
 
Bored of drinking them? Make it a smoothie bowl by adding more ice, less liquid, and utilizing all frozen fruits and vegetables. 
TIP: Just try it! I challenge you to try a smoothie bowl if you’ve never tried one before. They’re really fun to make and eat, especially when you top it with granola and extra crunchy super foods like cacao nibs, bee pollen, and Goji berries.
