Cardiovascular training is one of the keys towards living a healthier life. Whether you like high intensity or low intensity cardiovascular will help your body to burn fat, cardio can also provide your body with a huge range of health benefits such as.
 
+	Strengthening your immune system 
+	Strengthening your heart 
+	Help to decrease high blood pressure 

Motivation to keep up Cardiovascular training can be difficult especially if you are using the wrong technique, not seeing the results you want, and falling into habits that could be hindering your results. 

### Below are a few tips to help keep you on track! 

##### Start keeping track of your results. 

If you are serious about making progress with your cardio and general health, keeping track of your results is super important. In the first few weeks (and months), you may not notice changes in your body straight away. However, tracking the time or distance of your cardio workouts can help you to see other ways you are making progress. Maybe you’re walking or running the same distance in less time, or completing your reps more easily. That’s a sign you may be ready to increase the intensity of your workout. 
You can track your results by using your phone, there are many apps available my favourite one to use is map my run.

#### Avoid losing concentration and zoning out. 
Cardio can be a great way to catch up on your favourite drama, however, if you are doing this often turning your head to watch the screen, this could affect your posture, which may increase your risk of injury. You might also get a little caught up in the show which could mean your body isn’t working as hard as what you could be! 
Instead of trying to watch something, listen it instead. Make your own Playlist, choose songs that motivate you. I recommend choosing something upbeat that encourages you to keep your heart rate. 
Music can also help you keep rhythm when running and it should also stop you from feeling bored mid-way through your workout. However, we can probably all agree that listening to our favourite songs makes us feel awesome! 



#### You slack off when you are doing your HIIT workouts by yourself. 
Being slow to increase the intensity during interval training or resting for too long means you really aren’t pushing your body to the levels you could be. 
Starting timing your rest intervals and work intervals, you can you this one on your phone. 
This allows a bit of recovery and for you to catch your breath. Just remember that with HIIT, you aren’t necessarily wanting your body to recover fully after each interval, just long enough for you to exercise at capacity during the next work period. Setting a timer will stop you from losing track of your rest periods and keeps you on schedule. Staying on top of the work/rest periods may help encourage much better endurance and lung capacity. 
Try out this interval timer.

While managing a cardio routine seems much easier than following a set of exercises, there is a lot more involved than you might think! Regularly monitoring your cardio habits can certainly help you see areas that might need a bit more work and focus, as well as where you are making great progress.
