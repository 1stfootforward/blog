Choosing the right pair of shoes to wear on a regular basis can help ensure the long-term health of your feet, as well as your entire body. The best fit for you depends on your daily use, but nothing is more important than comfort. Not only do ill-fitting shoes make you uncomfortable all day, but they can also cause foot pain or aggravate pre-existing conditions.

If you go to training or the gym and come home with aching feet this could be a sign your shoes don’t fit you properly. Our feet have so many small bones and ligaments to help keep us moving and balanced, so they need to be well supported and looked after.

#### Below are some common shoe fitting problems.


 +	Heel Pain.

	Think about the way your foot moves when you exercise: your heel makes contact with the ground constantly so it needs to be padded to reduce impact and stress.
	If you have heel pain especially after you have just exercised take a look at your shoes if the heel part is worn out it’s time to go buy some new shoes!
	Also, have a look for any unevenly worn shoes as this could be a sign of a problem with the way your foot hits the ground (gait pattern). A sneaker that supports your foot structure can help you manage some movement problems as long as it fits correctly. Have a shoe fitting regularly, as our feet can change as we age.

+	Ankle Pain.

	If your ankles aren't  supported they could roll in excessively, then the rest of your body may attempt to compensate for that imbalance. In the long term, an imbalance may even lead to tension and pain in the foot, hip or lower back.

+	Sore Toes.

	You should be able to wiggle your toes when you are wearing your sneakers so buying shoes remember to always make sure you have a little bit of space between your toes and the start of the shoes. If you have ever felt pain in your toes after walking or running this could be a sign your toe box in your shoes are too small putting pressure on your toes causing pain and discoloration of your toenails. Different sorts of socks affect how the shoe fits as well as your feet tend to swell as the day goes on.

+	Blisters
	
	Everyone has experienced the annoyance and pain blisters can cause. If you are prone to getting blisters after your workout, it could be an indication that your shoes are too tight or too narrow. All shoes are shaped differently so if a shoe fits a mates foot it’s unlikely to fit yours. Shoes are designed to provide support and comfort, whilst still allowing full range of motion. Sneakers that have been laced too tightly can also cause the shoe to rub, which may lead to blisters. Test out different lacing techniques to find a comfortable fit for you.


Shoes serve many functions. They protect our feet. They cushion our body weight. They allow us to play sports. They can make our feet feel comfortable or fashionable — hopefully both! Finding the proper shoes and making sure they fit are important for keeping your feet and your body happy, especially when you are training.

#### My best tips for buying your active shoes are:

+	A cushioned heel
+	A firm sole that doesn’t easily twist or bend, and flexibility. 
+	A soft breathable material for the upper of the shoe makes it more comfortable to wear for longer 		period of time and less likely to cause rubbing or skin irritation. 
+	The upper of the shoe should allow adjustment laces or straps. To comfortably hold the foot in place 	 with activity. 
+	There should be some arch support in the shoe or in the insert inside the shoe. 
+	Many shoes can be made to fit better simply by removing the factory insert and replacing it with a 		high-quality off-the-shelf orthotic. Custom orthotics are rarely necessary and should be prescribed by 	   your doctor for specific foot disorders.


Following these simple steps will help minimize your risk of shoe problems and foot problems. However, if problems persist go and see your local GP. Thanks Heather
