### What if you never brought that packet of biscuits in the 1st place? 

Cravings are our number 1 down fall when trying to lose weight, and those cravings can be made worse if every time you go to the pantry you see that packet of biscuits that your partner or flatmates brought in the shopping that week? 
Food cravings are usually our bodies way of telling us we need something and 9 times out of 10 the biscuits will not help us.

The best way to sort out your food craving problems is just understanding your body a bit better, and you can achieve this by keeping a food journal. Writing down the foods you are eating and how you feel afterward can really help map out what your body needs and when it needs it. 
Below are some common foods that are craved and tips on other foods that would satisfy your cravings and have a healthy effect on your body.

#### Lollies.

Eating sugary treats are a common craving especially around 3 pm. Eating lollies and simple carbs is a quick way to give yourself a boost of energy, however, this boost won’t last long and may lead to a blood sugar crash. What your body really wants is a rest! Replace that burst of energy from Lollies to an active activity like exercise, this will boost your energy levels far further than an easy fix from that sugary treat.

#### Fast Food.

This took me a long time to realize, I would overload with carbs to help fill the gap after a large workout, however, I found my self-eating double than I needed. Protein is what your body is really craving here. Your body wants nutrients to quickly repair and replenish itself. A protein shake is a perfect way to hit this craving on the head

#### Chocolate.

This is probably the most craved food out, and our bodies usually crave it as a coping mechanism to deal with stress and being over whelmed. Chocolate hits and boosts the feel good chemicals in our brain. Like most cravings, this is only a short term fix and it can be much more beneficial to try a meditation session instead.

#### Potato Chips.

The increased craving for potato chips usually means you are craving salt and this could be because of an iron deficiency. A common problem in women who are menstruating. However just eating extra iron may not be enough focus on calcium, potassium and vitamin C will help your bodies absorb the iron better 


If you are craving nothing but as soon as you open the pantry door you still see those biscuits, you may just be bored. More likely than not what your body really wants is water! The majority of people are usually walking around dehydrated. 
Did you know the last sign of being dehydrated it thirst? 
So the next time you reach for a “craving” remember to have a tall glass of water 1st, I’m sure you will be surprised by the difference a glass of water makes.
