Eating out is a very often occurrence especially on the weekend. When we are on a mission to lose 
weight this can be a huge block to our social lives especially if you say no to outings that you think will 
take you off track.  
You can actually dine out successfully and keep your social life running whilst still hitting your goals if 
you follow a few simple rules you can have it all. 
 
##### Know the menu before you go.
 
Places are usually booked in advance so use this as an advantage. Check out the menu online to 
Choose your meal before you get there and stick to your decision. Choose grilled items, salads and 
vegetable sides.

##### Be the 1st to order your meal. 

You have come prepared you know what you want, so get in and order 1st before you are tempted for your mate's meal of choice.  
 
##### Ask questions about your chosen meal. 

The server should have good knowledge about the dishes on the menu for you to rack their brains, or if 
not they can go ask the chefs. Some good questions to ask are: 

+ How is the dish prepared? 
+ Can it be modified? 
+ Do you have any low-fat or low-calorie options? 
+ How large are the portions?  
+ Do you do half size portions? 
+ Can I make substitutions?

Don't be afraid to make special requests. For example, ask that foods be served with minimal butter, 
margarine or oil. The chef should be able to accommodate your needs. A common substitution is swapping your fries for a side of vegetables or salad

##### Don't be seduced by words and photographs
 
Mouth-watering descriptions like "tender, juicy chicken breast" or "ripe heirloom tomatoes" are 
increasingly common on restaurant menus. Be extra aware of sensory terms like "velvety" mousse and 
nostalgic ones like "legendary" spaghetti and meatballs. Research shows that words that promote taste 
and texture or appeal to diners' emotions can increase sales by 23%, and can even influence the way 
you think the food tastes.

##### Stay away from snacking.
 
The most damage often occurs before the actual meal begins: Entrees are loaded with fat. 
Besides that, they take away your appetite for the healthiest foods to come. Avoid them. Even the 
freebies like chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants or a basket of rolls and butter 
can pile up fat and calories that you don't need. If you can't exercise control, have your 
server remove the temptation. 

 
##### Be salad savvy.
 
Ask your server to serve dressings on the side. By doing this you can add little bits as you go. This also 
gives you the option of taking the salad home at the end if you canâ€™t finish it. 
Choose a green salad over a starchy salad. As potato, macaroni, and coleslaw salads are usually heavy in 
mayo, sugar, and calories.

##### Go low on sides. 
 
Substitute high-calorie side dishes such as fries, bread, and pasta to low-fat options such as steamed vegetables, brown rice or fresh fruit.  
 
##### Practice portion control.
 
Restaurants serve mountains of food about two to three times the quantity that we need in a meal, so they charge more. Consider Sharing a meal with a friend or ask for a doggie bag at the start of the meal. We only need to eat till we are about 80% full, not stuffed. Eating slowly will help you recognize cues that you are full. 
  
 
By following these rules whilst eating out will help you achieve your goals without the restrictions!
