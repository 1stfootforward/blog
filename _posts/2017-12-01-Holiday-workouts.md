7 HIIT Workouts Perfect for the Holidays (Equipment-Free!)

One of the biggest excuses people have for not working out over the holidays is that they just don’t have the time.

That’s why I’ve put together this resource list of seven quick but really effective workouts you can do over the next month when you’re totally stressed out and strapped for time.

Each of these workouts can be done using just your own bodyweight, so you can do them at home (or wherever you are for the holidays) without having to take the extra time to trek to a gym.

The workouts themselves range from four minutes long to 16 minutes—so no matter how much time you have, you can still fit one in.
No excuses!
Here are your holiday HIIT workouts:

Would love to hear how you all go with this holiday workout! This time of year is full of good food and drink, so to allow of to eat guilt free is remembering to move as much as possible. I hope these workouts help you achieve your goals or help you maintain your hard work. 
Hope you all have a Safe and Happy holiday break! Thanks Heather
