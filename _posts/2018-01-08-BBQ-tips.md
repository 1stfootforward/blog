Summertime brings us lots of opportunities to get outside, and this includes eating and cooking outside too. 
The typical kiwi BBQ can lead to a high-calorie intake and that doesn’t include our drinking habits. So how can you have an amazing BBQ get-together without all the extra calories?

##### Check out my top tips and recipes below.
 
### Flavour your food smartly.

### Marinating your meat it a must do, however, try to avoid store bought marinades. Make your own using a variety of herb and spices. 
    My favourite go too ones are: 

+	Lime and lemons

+	Fresh garlic
+	Rosemary
+	Sage
+	Worchester sauce, Soy sauce
+	Olive oil, coconut oil
+	Vinegar
