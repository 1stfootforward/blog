At this time of year temptation is high with all the sweet treats around. So Ive put together my 5 favourite go to recipes. 

By using warm spice mixes such as ginger and nutmeg, you can add festive and familiar flavours without additional sugar. These healthy Christmas treats are great to make with the kids as well and easy to wrap up as gifts for neighbours and friends.

### Almond and Cinnamon Star cookies.

##### Ingredients.

+ 1¾ cups of freshly ground almonds. 
+ ¾ cup of coconut sugar. 
+ 1 tablespoon of ground chia seeds.
+ 2 tsp cinnamon.
+ 2 tbsp of cold water.
+ 1 tbsp maple syrup.
+ 1 tsp vanilla.

##### Method.

+ Start by grinding the almonds into a flour if you are using whole almonds.
+ Place the ground chia seeds and the water into a small bowl. Whisk together with a fork and set aside to thicken for about 10 minutes.
+ Place the coconut sugar, ground almonds, cinnamon and vanilla into a food processor, and mix.
+ Add the chia-mix and maple syrup and combine everything for about 30 seconds until a sticky dough forms. If the dough is crumbly, and not sticky, add a teaspoon of cold water.
+ Pre-heat the oven to 160°C.
+ Roll the dough out between two pieces of baking paper. Make sure not to roll it out too thin - it should be around 5 mm thick. Using star shaped cutters, cut out about 30 stars.
+ Place the cinnamon stars on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes until transferring them to a cooling rack.
+ Tip: Store the Almond and Cinnamon Christmas Cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for the best result.
