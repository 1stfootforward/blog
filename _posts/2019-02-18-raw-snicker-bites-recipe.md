##### Caramel Layer:

+ 1 cup Dates, diced, pitted

+ 1 tsp Vanilla

+ Soak the Dates in warm water for 10 minutes. Set aside.
+ Blend oats in a Blender for 45-60 seconds until smooth and fluffy. Remove from blender.
+ Drain any excess liquid off of the dates (they should be relatively moist, but not dripping) and add them to the blender with the remaining ingredients for the Caramel. Blend until thick and smooth, scraping the sides of the device if necessary.
+ Remove the Date “Caramel” from the blender. Add the Oat Flour to the blender (no need to rinse) with ¼ cup of the Date Caramel and process until well incorporated. This should form a slightly sticky “dough” that will hold together when you pinch it.
+ Firmly and evenly press the Oat Flour Nougat into a small and narrow container (I used a loaf tin)
+ Use a spatula to spread the remaining Date Caramel evenly over the Nougat, then sprinkle the Peanut Pieces over the Caramel. Use your fingers to press the Peanuts into the Caramel layer, so they stick.
+ Place this in the freezer for 60-90 minutes, until firm.
+ Remove the frozen “filling” from the container, then use a sharp knife to cut it into bar-sized pieces. Return these to the freezer while you melt your chocolate.
+ Melt your Chocolate
+ Place 1 bar into the bowl of melted Chocolate. Use two forks to “flip” the bar, until it is coated in chocolate on all sides. Remove the bar from the melted Chocolate, letting any excess chocolate drip off. Then, place it onto a plate lined with baking paper. Repeat with the remaining bars.
+Place the bars in the fridge for 5-10 minutes, to allow the Chocolate to harden.
+Serve and enjoy! Bars are best stored in the fridge and will last there for up to 10 days. You can also place them in the freezer, where they will last for up to one month – just let the bars thaw for 5 or so minutes before enjoying.
