### Method 
+ Put  mozzarella & cream cheese in a medium size  microwaveable bowl
+ Microwave for 1 min, stir and then another 30 sec, stir (very hot!)
+ Stir in egg &  almond flour
+ Wet hands and spread “dough” thin on parchment paper. It should spread evenly with dough-like consistency (if “stringy” then your cheese has hardened too much—just put it back in the microwave for maybe another 20 seconds)
+ Dock (poke rows of holes) with a fork to avoid bubbling
+ Sprinkle with garlic salt
+ Put in 200 degree oven
+ After about 8 minutes, check it and poke holes where any large bubbles may be.
+ Continue cooking for a total 12-14 min, or until slightly brown on top.
It should look like this:
