Muesli is an extremely popular breakfast and snack food with a wealth of health benefits, including its ability to lower cholesterol, regulate digestion, aid in weight loss, and improve heart health. It also helps increase energy, prevent anemia, and promote proper organ function. 
Making your muesli into a bar makes it an easy to grab healthy snack. Whilst store brought muesli bars are usually high in sugar, making your own can help eliminate it and boost a healthy snack.
