A slice of sourdough stacks up very nicely against conventional white bread in terms of protein, vitamin and mineral content, as well as the presence of prebiotics. While everything should be enjoyed in moderation, this is certainly a bread you can feel good about eating.

### Vitamin and Mineral-Rich.
Sourdough is a great source of several minerals such as iron and selenium. Iron is an essential part of red blood cell production and energy metabolism, and selenium helps protect our immune system, cells, and tissue. Sourdough is also a great source of many B vitamins, which assist in proper nervous system function and help regulate our metabolisms.

### Prebiotics & Probiotic-like Benefits.
Prebiotics are a type of indigestible fiber that keep your gut healthy by feeding the good bacteria, called probiotics, that live there. The presence of prebiotics in sourdough is thought to make it easier to digest than many other breads and the presence of probiotic cultures have shown to increase vitamin and mineral absorption. The probiotics themselves don’t survive the baking process, but the lactic acid bacteria produced during fermentation remains and provides the benefits. The presence of lactic acid bacteria in sourdough has shown to also contain antioxidant benefits, safeguarding your body against illness.

### Protein Source.
One slice of sourdough has more protein than an egg, making it a sneaky way to increase your protein intake. The high protein content can be partially attributed to the tedious sourdough preparation process. All the resting and folding involved in preparing the dough for baking helps to activate its gluten content.
